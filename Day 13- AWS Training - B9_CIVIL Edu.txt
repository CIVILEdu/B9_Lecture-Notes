Concept of Virtualization
---------------------------------------

~ For any application, we need to AWS 3 Tier Architecture

~ 3 Tier Architecture of AWS - Web Server, App Server, and DB Server

~ To host these servers, we need Separate Hardware, CPU, Network, Storage....

~ Assume that all the servers have the same capacity (4 Core, 16 GB)

~ Virtualization is a concept of providing a single server to multiple parts (Web, App, DB Server) by allocating individual storage space.

~ In order to allocate the resources for all the three server individually in a single server, a concept called Hypervisor is available.

~ 4 C 16 GB

	1C - 2GB - Web
	1C - 2GB - App
	1C - 2GB - DB

	We still have 1C and 10 GB

~ To split the components and to allocate the resources individually to all the servers, we will use a software called as "Hypervisor"

~ XEN (till 2019), NITRO (from 2020)

~ Types of Virtualization:
1. HVM (Hardware Virtulization Machine / Fully Virtualized Machine) - 2019
2. PVM (Para Virtualized Machine) - 2018
