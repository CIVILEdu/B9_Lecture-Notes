Storage Formats in AWS
======================
1. File Level Storage
	EFS - for Linux OS, NFS Protocol, 5GB Storage for 12 months, EFS automatically grows & shrinks 				when you add/remove files.
	FSx - for Windows OS, SMB Protocol

2. Block Level Storage
	EBS - Elastic Block Storage
		30 GB Storage for 12 Months.
		Used for low level operations.

3. Object Level Storage
	S3 - Simple Storage Service

======================
Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
======================
For any EC2 Instance, we can assign 2 types of storage.
1. Block Level Storage - EBS, Instance Store (Outdated)
2. File Level Storage - EFS (Linux OS), FSx (Windows OS)

Note: By default, whenever we create an EC2 Instance, an EBS Volume will also be created.

~ EC2 and EBS are independent. They are connected by a network (VPC - Public Network, Private Network).
~ When we want the Persistant Storage then we will use the EBS Volumes.
~ Persistant Storage is nothing but the data available in the EC2 instance will not be deleted.
~ In Instance Store the data can be stored for a temporary period.
~ If an EC2 Instance is stopped, the EBS volume will be running in the back-end and hence it is called as Persistant Storage.
~ For one EC2 Instance, we can attach 16 EBS Volumes. 64 TB
~ 1 EBS Volume can be connected with multiple EC2 Instances and this feature is called "EBS MultiAttach"
~ The limitation of EBS MultiAttach feature is, the EC2 Instances which are running on Nitro Hyperviser only for those instances we can attach multiple EBS Volumes.
~ EBS Volumes are based on AZs.

Types of EBS Volumes:
-----------------------------------
1. SSD Type - Better Performance
2. HDD Type - Slow Performance
3. Previous Generations

~ The advantage of using SSD Type EBS Volumes is, it works based on "IOPS (Input Output Per Second)."
~ HDD Type will function based on "ThroughPut" Method
~ HDD Type EBS Volumes will be used for Big Data Analytics Works.

Types in SSD:
1. General Purpose (GP)
		1.1 Whenever there is a normal usage then we can select the GP Volume Types.
		1.2 By default, whenever an instance is launched, we will get GP type of volumes.
		1.3 You always have the chance to change the Volume Types.
		1.4 GP is divided into two categories
				1.4.1. GP2
				1.4.2. GP3
2. Provisioned IOPS
		2.1 When you want to access the data at a fast level, then we can select the Provisioned IOPS
		2.2 Provisioned IOPS is divided into three categories
				2.2.1 io1 (Only for Nitro based instances)
				2.2.2 io2 (Only for Nitro based instances)
				2.2.3 io2 block express (It can used only for R5 Instance Types)

gp2 - IOPS: 300 / 3000
gp3 - IOPS: 3000 / 16000
io1 - IOPS: 100 / 5000
io2 - IOPS: 100 / 1,00,000
io2 block express - >= 1,00,000

=============
Snapshots
=============
~ The back-up of EBS Volumes is called as SNAPSHOTS. In the backend, they will be stored in the S3 Buckets of our AWS Account.
~ The buckets in which the Snapshots are being stored cannot be accessed. These buckets are called as Opaque Buckets.
~ These snapshots will be stored in the "Snapshots" section in EC2Console.
~ AMI - Backup of the EC2 Instances.


EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume and write a copy of the data in the volume to S3, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones
Snapshots are incremental backups and store only the data that was changed from the time the last snapshot was taken.
Snapshots can be used to create new volumes, increase the size of the volumes or replicate data across Availability Zones.
Snapshot size can probably be smaller than the volume size as the data is compressed before being saved to S3.
EBS Snapshots can be used to migrate or create EBS volumes in different AZs or regions.


Life Cyle Manager
----------------------------
Automate the creation, retention, copy and deletion of snapshots and AMIs
In order to automate the backup of snapshots on daily basis, we will use Life Cyle Manager.
