Recovering Deleted Objects from S3 Bucket
=====================================
There are two pre-requisites that can be followed in order to recover the deleted objects:
1. Enable Versioning
2. Enable the Show Versions, and you can see the file with Delete Marker tag

Tasks:
-----------
1. Create a bucket and Enable Versioning
2. Upload 1 or 2 objects
3. Delete the Object from S3 Console
4. Enable the "Show Versions" toogle bar
	You can see a file with "delete marker" tag
5. Select the file which is having "delete marker" tag and Delete that file
6. Disable the "Show Versions" toogle bar and you will be able to see the deleted object

======================
AWS S3 MFA Delete
======================
MFA - Multi Factor Authentication

~ If you dont want to give the permission to delete an object, we can Enable MFA Delete Option.
~ MFA Delete can be enabled by using CLI or SDK or API
~ MFA Delete cannot be enabled/disabled by using AWS Console
~ By default, MFA Delete will be Disabled.
~ The bucket must have the Versioning Enabled
~ MFA Delete will work at Bucket Level

How to enable and disable MFA Delete using CLI
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:
----------
1. Create a bucket by enabling the versioning
2. Check for the MFA Delete default state
	Open Bucket ----> Properties ----> MFA Delete ---->Disabled
3. Upload an object
4. Activate MFA in IAM Service
		Click on Account Name  ----> Security Credentials ----> Assign MFA ----> Scan the QR Code ----> 			Enter the 2 consecutive Codes visibile in Google Authenticator App

		arn:aws:iam::374915553631:mfa/amazon-aws

5. Create Access Key and Secret Access Key
		IAM Console  ----> Create Access Key ----> Create Access Key
		AKIAVOSVVLFPS4WZ447B
		qmATTV5y5tZ0PkEQQ2LFkyQlT9TZhYuU2y6rN9Cv

6. Open Command Prompt
	
	6.1 Create a profile
			aws configure --profile civiledu
	6.2 Enter Access Key and Secret Access Key
	6.3 Lets Enable MFA Delete
			aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket mfa-demo-23mar --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::374915553631:mfa/amazon-aws mfa-code" --profile civiledu
	6.4 Verify whether the MFA Delete is Enabled or Not
			Open Bucket ----> Properties ----> You can see MFA Delete - Enabled

7. Go to the Bucket and delete a file
	Select the object and delete it
	The object will get deleted
	Enable Show Versions Toogle Bar
	Select the file which is not having "delete marker" tag and delete that file
		You will not be able to delete that file

8. Disabling the MFA Delete
		aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket mfa-demo-23mar --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Disabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::374915553631:mfa/amazon-aws mfa-code mfa-code" --profile civiledu

Note: CLI has to be installed in your PC

======================
AWS S3 Object Lock
======================
~ S3 Object Lock will help you to prevent objects from being deleted or over-written for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

~ Extra layer of protection for our objects.

Features S3 Object Lock:
-----------------------------------------
1. Retention Mode
	1.1 Governance Mode
			Whenever you are going to enable the S3 Object Lock using Governance Mode, users cannot 				over-write or delete an object, until or unless they have the special permissions.
			
			Only Root User will have the permission to delete the object.

	1.2 Compliance Mode
			Whenever you are going to enable the S3 Object Lock using Compliance Mode, even the Root 				User also cannot be able delete an object


2. Retention Period

	Protects an object for a fixed amount of time.
	Once after the retention period is completed, automatically the users (IAM User or Root User) can 		delete the objects.
	In compliance mode, retention mode cant be changed and retention period cannot be shortned.


3. Legal Holds

	Independent of retention periods.

Tasks:
------------
1. Create a bucket - Versioning Enabled
	1.1 Advanced Settings ----> Object Lock -----> Enable ----> Create Bucket

2. Upload 2 objects
3. open an object ----> Properties ----> Object Lock Retention ----> Edit ----> Enable ----> 

======================
AWS S3 Replication Setup
======================
~ In S3 Bucket we can store multiple objects.

~ To avoid the accidental deletion of objects or a bucket, if we want to maintain a duplicate files of all the orginal date then we can use Replication Setup

Types of Replications:
----------------------------------------
Replication can be done in 3 ways:
The duplciate copies can be stored in 3 ways:
	1. Another bucket which is available in same region and same account
	2. Another bucket which is avilable in different region and same account
	3. Another bucket which is avilable in different account

Suppose if main bucket is stored in standard storage class, the duplicates objects can be stored in different storage class also, inorder to avoid object storage charges.

Tasks:
-----------------
1. Create 2 buckets with Versioning Enabled.
2. For first bucket, we shall enable the Replication
3. Open Bucket 1 ----> Management ----> Replication Rules ----> Create Replication Rule ----> Name: demorule ---->
