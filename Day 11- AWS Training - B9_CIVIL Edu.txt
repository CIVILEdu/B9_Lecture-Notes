S3 Life Cycle Management
========================
Problem-1
---------------
~ Client is having some apps. These apps are generating some 100s of files on daily basis. Now the client needs to store all these files in cloud environment.

Ans: AWS - S3

Problem-2
---------------
~ For the first 3 months, the files are going to be used by the customers - STANDARD

~ After 3 months, these files may or maynot be accessed by the customers - STANDARD

~ For the next 6 months, these files are not used frequently, but whenever customer needs the files, they should be accessible  - STANDARD

~ For the next 24 months, these files should be available, but they maynot need an immediate access  - STANDARD

~ After the 24 months, these files can be deleted  - STANDARD

Total duration of files: 3M + 3M + 6M + 24M = 3 Years

The question is it recommended to store all these 100s of files to store in the same storage class for 3 years?
YES...Pay-as-you-use

1 File of Size 100 MB. This file is going to cost 10 Rs./Month when you store in STANDARD Storage class

1st 3 Months : 3 x 10 = 30 Rs.
2nd 3 Months: 3 x 10 = 30 Rs.
3rd 6 Months: 6 x 10 = 60 Rs.
4nd 24 Months: 24 x 10 = 240 Rs.

Total Cost for 3 years for each file = 360 Rs
As a solutions architect, you have to optimize the cost by changing the storage classes.

~ In order to change the storage classes, we will use a concept called S3 LCM.

~ Lets understand how this LCM will optimize the cost of files.

~ For the first 3 months, the files are going to be used by the customers - STANDARD

~ After 3 months, these files may or maynot be accessed by the customers - INTELLIGENT TIER

~ For the next 6 months, these files are not used frequently, but whenever customer needs the files, they should be readily availble for access  - IA:STANDARD

~ For the next 24 months, these files should be available, but they maynot need an immediate access - GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVAL

~ After the 24 months, these files can be deleted  - STANDARD


The question is who is going to change the storage classes for the stipulated duration?
	Manual work is impossible.
	S3 LCM - Automation process

In S3 LCM, we have two types of configurations:
1. Transition Policy: If we want to change the file from one storage class to another storage class, then we will use Transition Policy.

2. Expiration Policy: If we want to delete the files after a stipulated duration, we will use Expiration Policy.

Tasks:
------------
1. Create Bucket
2. Create Life Cycle Rule for the Bucket
3. Upload a file
4. Observe the change

Create bucket ----> Open Bucket ----> Management ----> Create life cycle rule ----> Name: lcm-rule ----> "Check" Apply to all objects in the bucket ----> Storage Class: Select any storage class ----> Duration: 1 day ----> Create rule

Go to bucket and upload an object.

After the specified duration, the files will convert into the different storage class.

=====================
S3 Event Notifications
=====================
~ If you want to get the notifications of all the activities that are happening in a bucket, then we will use S3 Event Notifications.

~ To get the event notifications, we have 3 options: 
	SNS - Simple Notification Service
	SQS - Simple Queue Service
	Lambda

Tasks:
----------------
1. Create bucket
2. Create event notification - SNS
	2.1 SNS: Create a topic
	2.2 SNS: Subscribe to the topic
3. Upload an object
4. Check for notification


SNS Console  Click on topic   Edit  Access Policy   Copy and Paste the second example policy from below link  Modify the policy accordingly  Save changes.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html

Bucket  Properties  Event Noti.  Create event notification  Event name  Event types: Select any one  Destination: SNS Topic  Choose from your SNS Topic  Save changes
Upload the objects in to bucket and check for notifications.
